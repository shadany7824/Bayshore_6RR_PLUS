### THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY FOR PRIVATE USE. THIS IS NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USAGE. RISK ON YOUR OWN FROM ANY FURTHER LEGAL CONSULT / CEASE & DESIST FROM OFFICIAL GAME DISTRUBUTOR WHEN HOSTING. DO NOT MESSAGE ME OR ANYONE HERE FOR SUPPORT ###



### Note : Since it's a private project at the moment, you're not allowed to leak, share, publish, making / provide any profit towards any services and usage for commercial purposes. Where implementing this specific source code being made into your own built for profitable activity, other than for own personal & private testing use is a dishonoured act. Future projects that we've planned to open source, will lead us to be demoralised. ###



### Reminder : ###

This codebase project was uploaded as an incomplete built, on purposely. I will not entertain any requests from anyone who asked for the complete version or guidance. 

Some features will be not available while in game. To implement those missing types for functionality, you need to do fork and build on your own with knowledge. 




This repo is based on the original repo (https://github.com/ProjectAsakura/Bayshore)
